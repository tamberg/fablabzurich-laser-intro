# FabLab ZÃ¼rich Laser Intro

## What's a FabLab?
A FabLab is an open workshop for digital fabrication.

Here's a [short presentation](http://www.tamberg.org/fablabzurich/2017/WasIstEinFabLab.pdf) of the general ideas.

## What's a laser?
A laser or laser cutter cuts wood, cardboard, leather, etc. (but no PVC) with light.

It comes with a software tool to configure speed and power settings.

We've got a [blue AKJ_6090](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/AKJ_6090) and a [red TT900](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/TT900) laser cutter.

They cut sheets of 600 x 900 mm, < 10 mm.

## What's a design?
A design (for a laser) is a vector based 2D drawing.

## The easy way
This should take about 15 minutes, if the laser is available.

### Download a design
Download a design e.g. from https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:laser

Our laser software works with DXF, SVG or PDF design files.

### Cut the design
Ask the lab manager for help with the laser cutter.

## The hard way

### Install some software

### Create your design

### Cut your design

### Iterate...
