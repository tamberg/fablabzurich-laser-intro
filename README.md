# FabLab Zürich Laser Intro

## What's a FabLab?
A FabLab is an open workshop for digital fabrication.

Here's a [short presentation](http://www.tamberg.org/fablabzurich/2017/WasIstEinFabLab.pdf) of the general ideas.

## What's a laser?
A laser or laser cutter cuts plywood, cardboard, leather, etc. (but [no PVC](https://lasergods.com/can-i-cut-vinyl-pvc-in-a-laser/)) with light.

It comes with a software tool to configure speed and power settings.

We've got a [blue AKJ_6090](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/AKJ_6090) and a [red TT900](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/TT900) laser cutter.

They cut sheets of 600 x 900 mm, < 10 mm.

## What's a design?
A design (for a laser) is a vector based 2D drawing.

The laser cutter can either cut or edge a line.

If you need both, use different colors.

## The easy way
This takes about 15 minutes, if a laser cutter is available.

### Download a design
Download a design e.g. from https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:laser

Our laser software works with DXF, SVG or PDF design files.

### Cut the design
Ask the lab manager for help with the laser cutter.

## The hard way
This takes more than 30 minutes, but it's worth your time :)

### Install 2D design software
[Download Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a free 2D design software.

No laptop? Use one of our computers.

### Create your design
Set units to mm and line width to 0.01 mm.

Draw some squares and circles.

Save as DXF or SVG.

### Cut your design
Ask the lab manager for help with the laser cutter.

Take notes and try it yourself next time.

### Iterate...
Adapt your design and your settings, try again.

Keep going, you will get there :)
