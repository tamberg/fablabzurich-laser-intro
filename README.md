# FabLab Zürich Laser Intro
A quick and easy introduction to laser cutting at [FabLab Zürich](https://zurich.fablab.ch/).

## What's a FabLab?
A FabLab is an open workshop for digital fabrication.

Here's a [short presentation](http://www.tamberg.org/fablabzurich/2017/WasIstEinFabLab.pdf) of the general idea.

## What's a laser?
A laser or laser cutter cuts plywood, cardboard, leather, etc. (but [no PVC](https://lasergods.com/can-i-cut-vinyl-pvc-in-a-laser/)) with light.

It comes with a [software tool](https://lightburnsoftware.com/) to configure speed and power settings.

We've got a [blue AKJ_6090](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/AKJ_6090) and a [red TT900](http://wiki.zurich.fablab.ch/TT900) laser cutter.

They cut sheets of 600 x 900 mm, < 10 mm.

## What's a design?
A design (for a laser) is a vector based 2D drawing.

The laser cutter can either cut or edge a line.

If you need both, use different colors.

## The easy way
This takes about 15 minutes, if a laser cutter is available.

### Download a design
Download a design e.g. from https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:laser

Or use a parametric design tool, e.g. a [box generator](https://ddg.co/?q=box+generator) (use _mm_).

Our laser software works with DXF, SVG or PDF design files.

### Cut the design
Ask the lab manager for help with the laser cutter.

## The hard way
This takes more than 30 minutes, but it's worth your time.

### Install 2D design software
[Download Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a free 2D design software.

No laptop? Use one of our computers.

### Set up Inkscape
Set _File > Document properties >_ [display units](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/managing-workspace.html?#document-properties-dialog) to _mm_.

Set _Object > Fill and stroke >_ [stroke width](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fill-and-stroke-dialog.html) to _0.01 mm_.

Enable _View > Display mode > [x] Visible hairlines_.

### Create your design
Draw some [squares](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/squares-and-rectangles.html) and [circles](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/circles-ellipses-and-arcs.html).

[Align and distribute](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/align-and-distribute.html) them.

[Save as SVG](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/saving.html) or [PDF](https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export-pdf.html).

### Cut your design
Ask the lab manager for help with the laser cutter.

Take notes and try it yourself next time.

Configure laser speed and power.

Set laser focus and origin.

### Stay safe
Make sure the air filter is switched on.

Always close the lid before cutting.

Never leave the laser unattended.

### Iterate...
Adapt your design and your settings, try again.

Keep going, you will get there :)
